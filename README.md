**JavaCheck.jar** is a Java file shipped with the Minecraft launcher. This isn't problematic for most, but those that prefer to use newer versions of Java, or mods that are incapable with older versions of Java, can't modify their profiles to use the version that isn't defaulted for that Java version.  
Thankfully, it's easy to bypass this by deleting this file, but is reinstalled after every update, so in the long run, this could be a useful application, especially for those rocking the beta launcher (like I do).

# Instructions
## Downloading
Download the .zip file found in the latest release, and extract it somewhere memorable (such as your desktop), and launch the .exe file inside it. This app will only run with manual execution, so you'll be required to run it after every update.

## Execution
Run `DeleteJavaCheckRewritten.exe`, and if there's no issues, the file should be deleted  
Another thing to note is that this file (javacheck.jar) will most likely be permanently deleted, so remember to run the right version of Java on newer installations

# Notices
* For the current moment, new files are in `DeleteJavaCheckRewritten` to prevent clashes and data loss. This'll be fixed later

# Future updates
* None currently planned
